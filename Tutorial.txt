Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building The Notes App

This tutorial explains exactly how this notes app works and how to build it.

Step 1: Set Up the Page Layout:

1. Create a main container for the app.(index.html)
2. Add a header that includes:
■ An icon (like a pencil) to visually represent notes.
■ The title “Notes”.
3. Add a button for adding notes. This button also has a small icon next to the text.
4. Below the button, add an empty section that will hold all notes dynamically.

Step 2: Style the App(style.css)

1. Set a full-page gradient background and a readable font.
2. Style the header:
■ Make the text large and bold.
■ Position the icon next to the text.
3. Style the Add Note button:
● Give it a gradient background and rounded corners.
● Place the icon inside the button next to the text.
4. Style the notes container:
■ Each note should be a rectangular editable area.
■ Make the note background white and the text dark for readability.
■ Give notes rounded corners and padding.
5. Add a delete icon inside each note:
■ Positioned at the bottom-right corner.
■ Easy to click to remove the note.

Step 3: Add Interactivity(script.js)

● Adding Notes:
         When the user clicks the Add Note button:
         1. Create a new editable note box.
         2. Add a delete icon inside it.
         3. Insert the note into the notes container.
         4. Save the updated list of notes into the browser’s storage.
● Deleting Notes:
         1.Detect clicks on the delete icon.
         2.Remove the corresponding note from the container.

Update the storage so it no longer appears after refreshing.


Editing Notes:
1.Make each note editable directly in the browser.
2.Any change (typing, deleting text) updates the stored notes automatically.
3.Ensure pressing Enter creates a new line instead of exiting the note.

Step 4: Save Notes Between Sessions

Use the browser’s local storage to save notes.

When the page loads:
1. Check if notes exist in storage.
2. If yes, display them in the notes container.

Whenever a note is added, edited, or deleted, update the stored notes. This ensures all changes persist even after refreshing the page.

 Summary:

1. Header with title and icon.
2. Add Note button with icon.
3. Notes container to hold dynamic notes.
4. Notes are editable, deletable, and persist via localStorage.
5. JavaScript handles creating, updating, deleting, and saving notes.
